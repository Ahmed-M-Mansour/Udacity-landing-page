# The project details  
- it's about Javascript DOM  and how to add some content to the page using JS. 
- it contains four sections every section has specific details. 
- when the page loading the js file automatically generates the nave bar and when you click any link in the navbar you will be scroll to the specific section that you clicked. 
- also, I make the top button feature to scroll the page to the top of the page.
